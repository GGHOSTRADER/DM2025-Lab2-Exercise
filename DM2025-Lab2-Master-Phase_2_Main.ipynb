      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation (Preprocessing):** This is often the most time-consuming stage. It involves:\n",

      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

       "*   **Good Form is Crucial:** This is a critical distinction. \"Failing\" with sloppy form or by using momentum (cheating) is not the same as failing with good form. The goal is to stimulate the muscle, not to injure yourself.\n",
       "*   **Subjective:** What constitutes \"failure\" can be somewhat subjective and depend on your individual strength, fatigue levels, and the specific exercise.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why is \"Set to Fail\" Used in Bodybuilding?**\n",
       "\n",
       "The primary reason bodybuilders incorporate sets to failure is to maximize **muscle hypertrophy** (muscle growth). Here's how it contributes:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Mechanical Tension:** Pushing to failure creates significant mechanical tension on the muscle fibers. This tension is a key driver of muscle protein synthesis, the process by which muscles repair and grow.\n",
       "2.  **Metabolic Stress:** When you go to failure, you often accumulate metabolic byproducts (like lactate) within the muscle. This \"pump\" and metabolic stress can also contribute to hypertrophy.\n",
       "3.  **Motor Unit Recruitment:** As you fatigue during a set, your body is forced to recruit more and more motor units (nerve cells that control muscle fibers) to try and complete the repetitions. Reaching failure ensures that you've maximally recruited the available motor units for that set.\n",
       "4.  **Progressive Overload:** Consistently pushing yourself to failure (or close to it) is a way to ensure you are progressively overloading your muscles, forcing them to adapt and grow stronger.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Important Considerations and Nuances:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Not Every Set Needs to Be to Failure:** While effective, training to failure on every single set can lead to:\n",
       "    *   **Overtraining:** Excessive fatigue, reduced performance, and increased risk of injury.\n",
       "    *   **CNS Fatigue:** Central Nervous System fatigue, which can impact your overall training capacity.\n",
       "    *   **Diminishing Returns:** The benefits of going to absolute failure might not be as significant on every set compared to the first few challenging sets.\n",
       "*   **Exercise Selection:** Some exercises are safer to take to failure than others. Compound exercises like squats and deadlifts carry a higher risk of injury if form breaks down completely. Isolation exercises (like bicep curls or triceps extensions) are generally safer to push to failure.\n",
       "*   **Experience Level:** Beginners might benefit more from learning proper form and not necessarily going to absolute failure on every set. More experienced lifters can better gauge their limits and recover from failure training.\n",
       "*   **Periodization:** Bodybuilders often incorporate periods of training to failure within their overall training plan, interspersed with periods of less intense training.\n",
       "*   **\"Reps in Reserve\" (RIR):** Many modern training philosophies advocate for training with a certain number of \"reps in reserve\" (RIR). For example, if you can do 10 reps but stop at 8, you have 2 RIR. Training with 0-2 RIR is often considered sufficient for hypertrophy, and absolute failure (0 RIR) might not always be necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary, a \"set to fail\" in bodybuilding is a set where you perform as many repetitions as possible with good form until you can't complete another rep. It's a powerful tool for muscle growth, but it should be used strategically and not necessarily on every single set to avoid overtraining and injury.**"

       "\n",
       "### Simple Definition\n",
       "\n",
       "A **set to failure** in bodybuilding is the act of performing repetitions (reps) of an exercise until you physically cannot complete another full repetition **with proper form**.\n",
       "\n",
       "Think of it like trying to push a car that has run out of gas. You push and push, and each step gets harder until you reach a point where, despite your maximum effort, you simply can't move it another inch. That's failure.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### What It Looks Like in Practice\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's use a bicep curl as an example:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Reps 1-5:** Feel relatively easy. You're in control.\n",
       "*   **Reps 6-8:** The difficulty increases. You have to focus more.\n",
       "*   **Reps 9-10:** These are a real struggle. Your muscle is burning, and the speed of the lift slows down significantly.\n",
       "*   **Rep 11 (The \"Failure\" Rep):** You try to lift the weight, but you can only get it halfway up before your bicep gives out and you can't complete the movement, no matter how hard you try.\n",
       "\n",
       "You have now completed a set of 10 reps to \"muscular failure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### The \"Why\": The Science Behind It\n",
       "\n",
       "Training to failure is a popular technique because it's believed to be a powerful stimulus for muscle growth (hypertrophy). The theory is based on three main principles:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Maximum Muscle Fiber Recruitment:** Your muscles are made of different types of fibers. Your body is efficient and only uses as many as it needs. The easy reps use smaller, weaker fibers. As the set gets harder, your brain is forced to recruit more and more fibers, including the largest, strongest ones that have the most potential for growth. The final, near-impossible reps are where you guarantee you've activated all of them.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Metabolic Stress:** The intense burning sensation you feel during those last few reps is a result of metabolic byproducts (like lactate) building up in the muscle. This metabolic stress is one of the key chemical signals that tells your body, \"This muscle was pushed to its absolute limit; we need to rebuild it bigger and stronger to handle this stress next time.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Mechanical Tension:** This refers to the physical force placed on the muscle fibers. By taking a set to failure, you ensure that you have subjected the muscle to the maximum possible tension for that given weight over the duration of the set.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### Important: Types of Failure\n",
       "\n",
       "Not all \"failure\" is the same. It's crucial to understand the difference for safety and effectiveness.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Technical Failure:** This is when your form starts to break down. For example, on a bicep curl, you start swinging your back to lift the weight. **This is the point where most people should stop the set.** Continuing past this point dramatically increases the risk of injury.\n",
       "*   **Muscular Failure (or Concentric Failure):** This is the classic definition described above. Your form is still good, but you simply cannot complete the positive (lifting) portion of the rep.\n",
       "*   **Absolute Failure:** This is when the muscle can't do *anything*—it can't even lower the weight under control (the eccentric/negative part). This is an extremely advanced and risky technique, often requiring a spotter for \"forced reps.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "For 99% of people, aiming for **technical or muscular failure** is the goal.\n",

       "### How to Use It Smartly\n",
       "\n",
       "Training to failure is a powerful tool, but like any tool, it should be used correctly.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Don't do it on every set.** A common strategy is to perform it only on the **last set** of an exercise.\n",
       "*   **It's safer on some exercises than others.** Taking a machine leg extension or a cable bicep curl to failure is much safer than taking a heavy barbell squat or deadlift to failure.\n",
       "*   **Listen to your body.** If you feel run down, overtrained, or your joints are aching, back off from failure training for a while.\n",
       "*   **Beginners should be cautious.** New lifters should focus on mastering perfect form before they even think about pushing to true muscular failure.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, a **set to failure** is a high-intensity technique where you push an exercise until you can't do one more rep with good form. It's a strong driver of muscle growth but must be used wisely to avoid injury and overtraining."

    "**`langextract`** is an open-source Python library from Google designed to create trustworthy data extraction pipelines. It uses LLMs to convert unstructured text into structured data with a focus on reliability and traceability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Precise Grounding:** Its core feature. It maps every extracted item to its exact character position in the original text, allowing for easy verification.\n",
    "*   **Reliable Structured Output:** Uses examples (few-shot prompting) to ensure the LLM's output consistently follows a predefined format.\n",
    "*   **Adaptable & No Fine-Tuning:** Can be adapted to any domain (e.g., legal, medical) simply by changing the examples and instructions, without needing to retrain a model.\n",
    "*   **Handles Long Documents:** Built to process lengthy texts that might exceed an LLM's standard context window.\n",
    "*   **Flexible LLM Support:** It is model-agnostic and works with various LLMs like Gemini, OpenAI models, and even local open-source models through Ollama.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Structure:**\n",
    "`System Instruction -> Task Description -> Examples (if not zero-shot) -> Text to Classify`\n",

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
