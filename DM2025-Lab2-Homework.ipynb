    "\n",
    "I also dropped the type column from the dataframe since it had 0 variance (all the values were the same so gives 0 information)\n",

    "In a small data exploration, I checked how long was the median text, min text and max text.\n",

    "My next step was to change the text label to a numerical label so it is easier to handle for the transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final submission, I did not subdivided the train set to train and validation because this would reduce the number of samples I have and since I was planning on using transformed based techniques, they are data hungry, so the more samples the better. I did some runs with Train/Validation set when I was trying different techniques. This is why you will find in the code, there is a flag that creates a full data train  or one split into train and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of model\n",
    "\n",
    "So for the model, I started with the assumption that using transformer models will excel better results than classic NLP like Bag of words or a bit more modern like words2vector since transformers have the skill to create embeddings that have contextual understanding of the words in the sentence and how they interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Hugging Face libraries and ecosystem to fine tune pretrained transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given my hardware restrictions of i9 13 gen intel, GPU 4060 8 Gigas Vram and 32 Gigas ram.I had to choose models that excel good understanding of text but were also trained in corpus that had extensive lexicon or social media type jargon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore I went in concrete with Three models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **DistBert**: Smaller and faster to fine tune, is the go to model when computation resources are tight but this model performance was quite low from start (with all its variations I tried in Hyper parameters and weights). I saw its performance and compared my accuracy with top performers on the Kaggle rank. Realized this model was probably not the best option.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Deberta_v3_Base**: Rich contextual training with 184M Parameters. A large model of it exist and could outperform but Requires approximately 16gigas of Vram. This model is considered a great choice for general purpose NLP tasks. I fine tuned with the data set the Deberta_v3_Base.\n",
    "\n",
    "classification Head: I ended Using a simple linear classification head due to MLP heads tend to overfit easier (I did run a few tests with MLP, the less hidden layers, the better the performance, confirming this but still underperform). Perhaps in a data sets with a much bigger number of samples, the MLP could be better but with only 47k samples, simpler is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also played with the number of batches and lowered the length, since more length for shorter actual sentences meant a lot of padding and wasted computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran several versions of it but the one that performed the best had a slower rate of learning at 1e-5.The reason this may have caused higher accuracy is due to its because dataset is not too big so a more aggressive learning rate may forget quickly and overfit easier on this size of data and emotional nuances.I also played around with the number of epochs to see if this affected, but learning rate seem to be the hyperparameter with the most impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "After enough trials, I decided to look into a model upgrade instead of trying to squeeze more accuracy out of the actual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Bertweet_large**: Trained in social media tweeter posts, which could be similar to my data set, so I thought this would be a good model to try. Same as before, since I fine tune this model after Deberta, I choose a simpler head, went with linear classification for classification/output of labels/logits. Is consider the Go-To model tasks involving social media, so I decided to give it a try too.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran several versions of it but the one that performed the best had a slower rate of learning at 1e-5 .The reason this may have caused higher accuracy is due to its the same as in deberta, aggressive learning will tend to overfit faster on this dataset size.I also played with the number of batches and lowered the length, since more length for shorter actual sentences meant a lot of padding and wasted computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Bertweet_Large, I found even stronger models but I ran into two challenges. One is that the data set may not be big enough for them, so they may overfit pretty easy and the second reason is that they are much bigger and complex models to manage so the fine tunning may be very painful and I did not have the required Vram to run them. One of those models was the Model DeBERTa-v3-large or an even bigger jump in power to LLM based ones like LLaMA-2-7B.\n",

    "## 2. Bonus Section (5 pts Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Mention Different Things You Tried\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deberta_v3_base**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I ran a training with the dataset without adding hashtags to the sentences, since not all of the sentences have hashtags, this could have changed the results in a good way, but the accuracy was actually lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) In this model I tried to smooth and a MLP head, but performance came back 3-4% lower than the best performing one. First head I ran, had 256 hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) I proceed to do several different tests with different hidden layer size, (256,64,32) which lead to show the less complex the head, the better that results where. Yet all were still lower than the linear head.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Made several tests with different hyper parameters on the linear head and found learning rate excel a good result, so kept those changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) In one of the rests, I thought about generating through LLM, alike samples of the ones I had to increase the number of samples for smaller emotions and balance more the data set ( since weighted samples did not work well). I generated between, 3000 to 5000 new synthetic samples through LLM with few shot prompting to show the LLM the structure and it could derive new ones. Sadly the results were disappointing, the accuracy went down from my top performing models between 1-2% lower, so the extra synthetic samples actually hurt the performance. I think the LLM probably did not do a great job generating new samples since the validation set did actually sky rocket to 81% but the actual test in Kaggle was only around 66%, this huge gap between them, makes me think that alot of the synthetic samples that went into train and validation, were extremely similar causing the model to have some information leakage and performing better in the validation set. With this method, I tried to give more samples to the model since transformer thrive on more information but was unsuccessful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DistBert**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I started with this model, I ran it with Train and Validation set, the score was around 0.67 but for my surprise, when I ran the inference in the test set,the actual accuracy was much lower than expected and this is were I started researching for newer models, since I was much lower in rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) I tried a second version of Distbert, one that fixed the imbalance of the samples by adding weights, but this version returned a lower accuracy than the plain Distbert previously done, since it would take away good forecasts of the most dominant label into smaller ones without really adding in a good way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**LightGBM**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model, I decided to go a more classic route and created several \"hand crafted\" features and sentiment features based on transformer. I ran a test just with intensity and sentiment features (No IT-IDF or Deberta/Bertweet logits), the result was my worst submission of all, a pretty bad model. My conclusion is that intensity and sentiment are not enough to forecast the nuances of emotions, more contextual relationship was needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Mention Insights You Gained\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine tunning transformer based techniques require patience and hardware, I could have played with more options but this training was not as running fast trainings and inferences on tabular data which is what I was more used to. This models could take from 70 minutes to 210 minutes of training per iteration which presented a challenge in keep trying more techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "One clear insight is that as good as transformers are, the classification head is still a very crucial step to consider, too complex for the data set an it will kill the work of the transformer. Classic tabular methods like LightGBM with enough contextual features and domain knowledge can still compete on smaller data sets with Transformers. I did not had enough time at the end to do hyperparameter optimization with LightGBM but its training time is considerable shorter (around 7 mins vs 75-175 mins of transformers), meaning this model is more convenient for HP optimization and could have helped excel better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer trained with more parameters and better lexicon will impact greatly the performance since they encode much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hard voting I used is based in naive rules, it did improved the accuracy, I think using the logits of each model and create a voting machine with a classificator may have excel better results too. Ensemble methods with several classifiers that have variance between them but close accuracy can help improve forecasting.\n",
